# C# Training

## Functions

### Description

Following functions you are about to develop in this training will help you to understand how to work with primitive types like string, integer, float and boolean, it will also teach you how to create simple reusable functions and combine them to bigger more complex functionatilites.

### String functions

* change whole text to uppercase/lowercase
* sort text by chars
* trim (deleting of char in text)
* cut of part of the text(chose from and to)
* find out position in text
* find part of text
* copy the text N times
* write down text reversed
* 1st letter after space will be uppercase
* set last words uppercase
* every second word will be uppercase
* return char on index N

* try to use trim without using (string.trim(char))


### Integer/Float functions

* basic math operations for int and int, int and float, float and float (+, -, *, /)
* Square and cube root/ square and cube power or X th power

### Loop functions

* write on screen numbers between two int parameters using do/while
* write on screen numbers between two int parameters using while
* write on screen numbers between two int parameters using for
* write on screen only odd numbers between two int parameters using for
* write on screen result of formula f(x) = x^(x-1), for numbers between two int parameters
* start displaying current time including milliseconds until a key is pressed in one second interval


### Technical details

Use:
* String class functions
* Math class functions
* if not required otherwise use plain simple functions accepting parameters of primitive types and returning required values
* use System.Threading.Sleep to wait one second
