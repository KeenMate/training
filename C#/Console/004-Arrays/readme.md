## Array

## Description

Create multidimensional array that contains numbers from 0 to 20. You will get width and height from income parameters. Then display the array in the center of console.
On the last line of the console ask user for a number by which you will divide the range 0 to 20 and colore the numbers accordingly. For example when user enters number 5 it will divide the numbers into 4 groups 0 to 4, 5 to 9, 10 to 14 and 15 to 20. The color of each group responds to ConsoleColor enumeration.
For example first group will be black, second group will be blue, third group will be cyan and forth group will be dark blue.
