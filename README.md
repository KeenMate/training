# Training materials for junior programmers

This repository contains training exercises for young programmers that need something more complex than create a factorial function as those will get you bored quickly. But don't expect too much, it's hard to find 

Our exercises are more challenging, they require a lot of self-study, searching in Google and they are also tricky and sometimes misleading to challenge your brain.

**But this is what programmer's real life is, so you are welcome.**

Trainings are somewhat in the order we think you should learn specific programming language or framework and they are also becoming more and more challenging.


## Basic rules

- Read the description, technical details and sometimes hints carefully
- Try not to over do it, stay on the level of the training. For example, yes you could of course use Linq's *ForEach* but use simple *for* if you are asked to do so
- Do you think you are done? Think again and try to reduce your code to minimum (and think about the performance as well)
- Follow the naming conventations for example https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms229045(v=vs.100).aspx


At the moment there are only C# trainings but we will add some Javascript as well.
